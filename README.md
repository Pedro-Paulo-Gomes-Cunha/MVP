# MVP

In this example, we have a Presenter that acts as a mediator between the View and the Model. It receives events from the View, processes user input using the Model and updates the View with the result. The View is implemented as a class that inherits from the Windows Forms Form and implements the IView interface.

The Model is implemented as a class that implements the IModel interface. Using MVP allows you to separate responsibilities between system layers, facilitating code maintenance and evolution.

I hope this example is helpful! If you have any further questions, I'm at your disposal.
